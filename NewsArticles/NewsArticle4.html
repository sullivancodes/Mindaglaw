                    <p>The developer whose plan to build nine single-bedroom apartments on Hoffman Avenue was rejected by the Valley Stream Board of Zoning and Appeals in May instead plans to construct a building with six two-bedroom apartments, which complies with village code.</p>
                    <p>The property, which touches Benedict Avenue and North Central Avenue, would be divided into three parcels: one for the apartments and two more that would each contain a 2 ½-story home with a two-car driveway. A variance is still being sought for the two colonial homes, which would be built on two 40-by-100-feet lots. No further action is required for the developer to move ahead with the apartment plans.</p>
                    <p>“After we get a decision on the two houses, we’re thinking of building what’s permitted there, which would be six two-bedroom units,” said Dominick Minerva, the developer’s attorney, who added that a few minor setback variances might be needed for the new plans, but no parking exceptions were needed.</p>
                    <p>The board debated the impact of nine bedrooms as opposed to 12 bedrooms for several sessions after the developer’s first presentation on May 3.</p>
                    <p>“Based on what we heard from the neighbors, and I know we give that a certain amount of weight, they thought nine one-bedroom [apartments] was the end of the world … As of right now they can do six two-bedrooms,” said board member Ed DeLucie. “So how many more people are going to come in with six two-bedrooms? The nightmare scenario seems to be worse to me with six two’s rather than nine one’s.”</p>
                    <p>Feedback from The Nassau County Planning Commission suggested that the nine single-bedroom proposal represented an “over-intensification of development” in the area and, if approved, could “establish a precedent for approving other non-compliant multi-family project[s] along this stretch of North Central Avenue.” The commission did not mention the two colonial homes in its feedback.</p>
                    <p>To persuade the board that the 40-by-100-feet lots were in line with the character of the neighborhood (the village code requires at least 50-by-100-feet lots), Minerva compiled a list of several other properties in the area that have been granted the exception. Board member Salvatore Pizzolo said that he didn’t recall such variances being granted.</p>
                    <p>“I haven’t seen any come before this board, at least while I’ve been here,” he said.</p>
                    <p>The board agreed to adjourn their decision about the two colonial homes until July 19, allowing Minerva more time to submit evidence of similar cases.</p>
                    <p>“The board has historically granted those variances,” Minerva said. “Even if it’s not the current board, I’m saying there is a precedent over the years — and I have decisions going all the way back to the ‘80s — the board has granted these variances.”</p>
